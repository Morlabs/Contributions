# Contribution Guidelines

## Introduction

Welcome to Mor Labs! This guide is designed to help you navigate through the contribution process, whether you're looking to complete a single task or take on a recurring role. By leveraging your unique skills and interests, you can significantly impact our progress and innovation in the DeAI revolution. Here, you'll find everything you need to identify opportunities, submit contributions, and understand the rewards process.

### How to Contribute

#### Step 1: Identifying Contribution Opportunities

At Mor Labs, your contributions are crucial to our development and growth. You can contribute through:

* **Single Task Contributions:** Defined projects or tasks with a specific goal.
* **Recurring Task Contributions:** Ongoing responsibilities requiring continuous attention.

To understand types of tasks that you can contribute, you can review the following for inspiration:

* [Morpheus Dework](https://app.dework.xyz/morpheus/)
* [Morpheus Improvement Proposals](https://github.com/Morlabs/MIPS/tree/main)
* [Morpheus Projects](https://github.com/Morlabs/Projects/blob/main/approved\_projects.md)

The above links are for guidance only. We recommend the following:

1. Check the [Approved Projects](https://github.com/README.md). Each Approved Project has a dedicated budget as well as a designated lead. Contact them on Discord to see where they might need help.
2. If there is a smallish task that you would like contribute (ex: a few hours of work), just go and do it. Then submit it to the [Single Task Proof of Submission Table](single\_tasks.md)
3. If the task or project is larger in scope and/or would require the input of multiple contributors or stakeholders, including such as if there are technical dependencies, create a [Morpheus Improvement Proposals](https://github.com/Morlabs/MIPS/tree/main)

#### Step 2: Submission Process

**A) Single Task Contributions**

To submit a Single Task Contribution, use the [Single Task Proof of Submission Table](single\_tasks.md). Make sure you have read the [Single Task Submission Guide](<Single Tasks/Single\_Task\_Submission\_Guide.md>)

**B) Recurring Task Contributions**

To submit a Recurring Task Contribution, use the [Recurring Task Proof of Submission Table](recurring\_tasks.md). Make sure you have read the [Recurring Task Submission Guide](Recurring\_tasks/submission\_guide\_recurring\_tasks.md)
