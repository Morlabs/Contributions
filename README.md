# Contribution Guidelines

# Introduction

Welcome to Mor Labs! This guide is designed to help you navigate through the contribution process, whether you're looking to complete a single task or take on a recurring role. By leveraging your unique skills and interests, you can significantly impact our progress and innovation in the DeAI revolution. Here, you'll find everything you need to identify opportunities, submit contributions, and understand the rewards process.

## How to Contribute

### Step 1: Identifying Contribution Opportunities

At Mor Labs, your contributions are crucial to our development and growth. You can contribute through:

- **Single Task Contributions:** Defined projects or tasks with a specific goal.
- **Recurring Task Contributions:** Ongoing responsibilities requiring continuous attention.

To understand types of tasks that you can contribute, you can review the following for inspiration: 

- [Morpheus Dework](https://app.dework.xyz/morpheus/)
- [Morpheus Improvement Proposals](https://github.com/Morlabs/MIPS/tree/main)
- [Morpheus Projects](https://github.com/Morlabs/Projects/blob/main/approved_projects.md)

The above links are for guidance only. We recommend the following: 

1. Check the [Approved Projects](https://). Each Approved Project has a dedicated budget as well as a designated lead. Contact them on Discord to see where they might need help. 
2. If there is a smallish task that you would like contribute (ex: a few hours of work), just go and do it. Then submit it to the [Single Task Proof of Submission Table](https://github.com/Morlabs/Contributions/blob/main/single_tasks.md)
3. If the task or project is larger in scope and/or would require the input of multiple contributors or stakeholders, including such as if there are technical dependencies, create a [Morpheus Improvement Proposals](https://github.com/Morlabs/MIPS/tree/main)  

### Step 2: Submission Process

#### A) Single Task Contributions 

To submit a Single Task Contribution, use the [Single Task Proof of Submission Table](https://github.com/Morlabs/Contributions/blob/main/single_tasks.md). Make sure you have read the [Single Task Submission Guide](https://github.com/Morlabs/Contributions/blob/main/Single%20Tasks/Single_Task_Submission_Guide.md)

#### B) Recurring Task Contributions 

To submit a Recurring Task Contribution, use the [Recurring Task Proof of Submission Table](https://github.com/Morlabs/Contributions/blob/main/recurring_tasks.md). Make sure you have read the [Recurring Task Submission Guide](https://github.com/Morlabs/Contributions/blob/main/Recurring_tasks/submission_guide_recurring_tasks.md)

## Governance and Fairness

MOR Labs employs a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called Trinity DAO, which utilizes a sub-DAO structure with clearly defined responsibilities. This structure allows each sub-DAO to operate and execute tasks swiftly.

Trinity DAO, governed by token holders, possesses the authority to veto any proposal, should the need arise. This mechanism ensures that sub-DAOs operate with agility and flexibility while remaining aligned with the interests of Trinity DAO and its token holders.

Each sub-DAO has its own council that oversees contributors and manages critical infrastructure related to that particular sub-DAO. The members of each council are elected by Trinity DAO, with their responsibilities and term outlined in a contract stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).

Furthermore, a community multisig can be employed to execute transactions within any sub-DAO, should a critical intervention be required. 

The organisational hierarchy of Trinity DAO is shown below.

Each contributor to Trinity DAO is provided with a HAT NFT, powered by [Hats Protocol](https://hatsprotocol.xyz), which grants them with special access permissions tailored towards their role. 

## Conflict Resolution

For disputes, especially regarding CRG decisions, the Arbitration Guild (AG) provides a structured resolution process, aligning with the [Mor Labs DAO Constitution](https://github.com/Morlabs/DAO) and community interests.
