These proposals can be submitted through the established governance processes, allowing the community to deliberate, refine, and collectively decide on their implementation.

Additionally, individuals with unique skill sets or specialized expertise not covered by the existing roles are welcome to propose the creation of new positions tailored to their capabilities.
